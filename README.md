SQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Layoffs Dataset
 Project Overview
This project showcases a complete **end-to-end data preparation and analysis process using SQL only**.  
I worked on a real-world layoffs dataset to first clean the data using SQL and then performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€” all within **MySQL**, without using Excel or Python.
The goal was to take a raw, messy dataset and turn it into an analysis-ready format, then derive meaningful insights directly using SQL queries.

Phase 1: Data Cleaning (cleaning_queries.sql)
Key operations performed:
- âœ… Removed duplicate rows using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs
- âœ… Handled `NULL` and blank values in industry, layoff counts, and other fields
- âœ… Trimmed inconsistent text entries (like trailing dots and mixed casing)
- âœ… Standardized country and industry names
- âœ… Converted string-based date columns into proper SQL `DATE` format
- âœ… Dropped unnecessary columns (like helper `row_num`)

All these queries are available in: **`cleaning_queries.sql`**

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (eda_queries.sql)
Key insights generated through SQL queries:
-  Most affected industries by total layoffs
-  Top countries with the highest number of layoffs
-  Companies with multiple rounds of layoffs
-  Layoff trends over time using grouped dates
-  Industry and country-wise breakdown using `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregate functions
All EDA queries are available in: **`eda_queries.sql`**

Tools & Technologies

- MySQL
- SQL Queries â€“ DDL, DML, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregates, Filtering
- No external tools â€” full project handled using SQL inside MySQL Workbench

What I Learned
- How to clean real-world data using structured SQL logic
- Writing efficient queries for grouping, aggregation, and filtering
- Applying analytical thinking using only SQL â€” no Python or Excel
- Structuring data projects in a clean and professional format

Final Note
This project proves that "SQL alone can handle both cleaning and analysis of data", making it an incredibly powerful tool for any aspiring data analyst.
