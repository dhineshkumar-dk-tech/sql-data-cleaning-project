SQL Data Cleaning Project â€“ Layoffs Dataset

Project Overview:
              This project focuses on **cleaning and preparing a real-world layoffs dataset** using **MySQL**. The dataset contains company layoff data across different industries and locations. The cleaning was performed entirely through **SQL queries**, making this a strong example of backend data preprocessing.

By cleaning this dataset, I aimed to prepare it for reliable analysis by removing inconsistencies, null values, and formatting issues that could affect the quality of insights.

 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL (Workbench)
- SQL (DDL, DML, Window Functions, CTEs)

Key Cleaning Tasks Performed

âœ… **Removed Duplicate Records**  
âœ… **Trimmed and Standardized Text Fields** (like `company`, `country`, `industry`)  
âœ… **Handled Null and Blank Values**  
âœ… **Cleaned and Converted Date Fields** into proper DATE format  
âœ… **Normalized Data Entries** such as inconsistent industry or country names  
âœ… **Removed Invalid Rows** with no meaningful data

Files Included

- `cleaning_queries_sql.sql` â€“ All SQL queries used in the data cleaning process
-  `raw_data.csv` â€“ Original dataset
-  `cleaned_data_sql.csv` â€“ Final dataset after cleaning 

 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- SQL query structuring for data wrangling
- Using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs to manage duplicates
- Data type conversions and NULL handling
- Real-world data cleanup for business analysis

Sample Insights Gained After Cleaning 

- Industry-wise layoff patterns
- Countries with the highest layoffs
- Companies with repeated layoffs over time

Final Note

This project is a great start to building my portfolio in data analytics, especially focused on backend SQL-based data preparation. More analytics-focused projects coming soon!
